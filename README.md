# Django Tutorials
1. Built Django Polls app as the one on @Django Documentations: *App name = **polls***
2. User Authentication: *App name = **user*** 

### My System Environment:
* Django == 2.2.7
* pytz==2019.3
* sqlparse==0.3.0
* Python 3.7.3

*Django is cross platform as long as you install the neccessary environment you'll get the app running*

The project is a simple polling app. Follow the procedure on the docs and be carefull not to leave anything out. It will work out just *perfectly*

I find it a good practice to clone a project while learning it, then when done, create your **own** project to see of you've grasp.
